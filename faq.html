<div class="faq-item">
  <h2 class="question">Are your cat collars safe for everyday use?</h2>
  <p class="answer">
    Yes, our cat collars are thoughtfully designed for daily wear. We use soft,
    lightweight, and pet-safe materials that feel comfortable around your cat’s
    neck. Each collar is carefully tested to ensure it does not cause irritation,
    discomfort, or restrict movement, allowing your cat to play, rest, and explore
    freely throughout the day.

<div class="faq-item">
  <h2 class="question">Do your collars include a safety breakaway feature?</h2>
  <p class="answer">
    Absolutely. Safety is our top priority. All our collars come with a breakaway
    buckle that automatically releases under pressure if your cat gets caught on
    something. This feature helps prevent choking or injury, giving you peace of
    mind while your cat explores both indoors and outdoors.

<div class="faq-item">
  <h2 class="question">What sizes do your cat collars come in?</h2>
  <p class="answer">
    Our collars are fully adjustable and designed to fit most cats comfortably,
    from playful kittens to fully grown adults. Each product page includes clear
    sizing guidelines so you can choose the perfect fit. We recommend leaving a
    small gap of two fingers between the collar and your cat’s neck for maximum
    comfort and safety.

<div class="faq-item">
  <h2 class="question">Can the collars be washed or cleaned?</h2>
  <p class="answer">
    Yes, our cat collars are easy to maintain. For best results, gently hand-wash
    the collar using mild soap and lukewarm water, then allow it to air dry
    completely. Regular cleaning helps keep the collar fresh, hygienic, and looking
    new for longer.

<div class="faq-item">
  <h2 class="question">Are your collars suitable for indoor and outdoor cats?</h2>
  <p class="answer">
    Our collars are designed for both indoor and outdoor cats. They are durable
    enough to handle outdoor adventures while remaining soft and comfortable for
    indoor lounging. The secure yet safe design ensures your cat stays stylish and
    protected wherever they go.
